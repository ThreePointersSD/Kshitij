# 📘 Day 1 – Foundations & Traversing Arrays  

## 🎯 Goal  
Understand how arrays are stored in memory, basic syntax, and how to traverse them.

---

## 🧠 Learn (60–75 min)

- [Theory] What is an array? (Definition & Purpose)  
- [Theory] Why use arrays vs. individual variables?  
- [Concept] Indexing (0-based vs 1-based).  
- [Concept] Memory layout (Contiguous storage).  
- [Logic] Looping (For loops vs. While loops).  
- [Logic] Forward traversal (0 to N-1).  
- [Logic] Reverse traversal (N-1 to 0).  

---

## 💻 Practice (75–90 min)

- [Code] Declare arrays (Syntax).  
- [Code] Take user input & print elements.  
- [Code] Access specific elements by index (e.g., `arr[4]`).  
- [Code] Print all elements on a new line.  
- [Code] Print elements in reverse order.  
- [Code] Count total number of elements.
